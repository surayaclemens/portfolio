                <p className='home__body'>"A <span className="home__body--purple">jack-of-all-trades</span> is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none." I like to think that's true. I did almost every job under the sun (service, teaching, research, sales, I could go on) before finding my place in tech. My meandering path used to feel scary, but now I think it's my <span className="home__body--forest">superpower</span>. With each role I developed different muscles, from empathy to patience to curiosity to grit, and I get to flex all of them as a dev. This industry can be a wild ride, but as a developer I get to be <span className="home__body--green">creative</span>, explore all kinds of problems and <span className="home__body--pink">solutions</span>, and belong to an enthusiastic community of <span className="home__body--yellow">lifelong learners</span>. Making apps and websites like this one is a challenging, fulfilling, and endlessly fun way for me to build a bit more beauty into the world üíê </p>

                I'm a dedicated developer who relishes opportunities to learn new things and thrives in environments that are values-driven. My colleagues know me as an initiative-taker, problem solver, excellent communicator, and big fan of making work fun. My friends know me as a language dork, avid sewist, and person obsessed with her dog. Let's make something great together :~)</p>
